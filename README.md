# User Management CRUD Application

This is a simple React.js application that demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation using a mock API (JSON Server) to manage a list of users. The application features a clean UI with a table displaying user information and options to add, edit, view, or delete users.
